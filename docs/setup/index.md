# Setting up ansible
It is imporant to differentiate between a production and a development environment. 

For development purposes, you can use your local computer as a control node. This is the easiest way to get started with Ansible. You can also use a virtual machine or a container to run Ansible.

In a production environment, you should use strict version control and run the playbooks from a central control node.
