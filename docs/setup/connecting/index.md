# Connecting to hosts
Ansible can connect to hosts in different ways. This page describes the different connection types and how to configure them.
For all connection types, you need to define the connection parameters in the Ansible variables. The connection parameters are different for each connection type.

The ansible control node will always require network connectivity to the target host.
